## üì° Networking Protocols

### **IP (Internet Protocol)**
- Moves data between devices on a network.
- Each device has a unique IP address.

### **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
- Reliable connection: ensures data is delivered and in the correct order.
- Slower but accurate (used in web browsing, email, etc.)

### **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
- Fast, but unreliable.
- No guarantee of delivery/order ‚Äî used for streaming, gaming.

### **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
- Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.
- Saves manual configuration.

### **DNS (Domain Name System)**
- Translates domain names (like `google.com`) into IP addresses.
- Acts like the internet's phonebook.

### **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**
- Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses inside a LAN.
- Used for local device-to-device communication.

### **MAC (Media Access Control) Address**
- Unique hardware address for network interfaces (like Wi-Fi cards).
- Used within LANs.

### **NAT (Network Address Translation)**
- Allows multiple devices to share one public IP address.
- Helps with internet connection + adds basic privacy.

## üåê Internet Protocols

### **HTTP / HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol / Secure)**

- HTTPS is encrypted for privacy (SSL/TLS).

### **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**
- Used to transfer files between computers over a network.

### **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**
- Used for diagnostic tools like `ping` and `traceroute`.
- Not meant for transferring data ‚Äî just status messages.

## üîê Security-Related Acronyms

### **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection Model)**
- 7-layer model to understand how data flows in a network.

### **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**
- Encrypts your internet connection and hides your IP.
- Used for privacy or secure remote access.

### **SSH (Secure Shell)**
- Encrypted protocol for remote login to another device.
- Common for managing servers.
