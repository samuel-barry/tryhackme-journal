# TryHackMe Progress Log

## 12 April 2025  
**TryHackMe Modules:**  
- Introduction to LAN (continued)  
- The OSI Model  

**Key Topics Covered:**  
- LAN: Network topologies, subnetting, ARP, DHCP  
- OSI Model: 7-layer breakdown, real-world protocol mapping, encapsulation  

**Reflection:**  
Really starting to grasp the building blocks of networking. The OSI model gave me a solid mental map for how data flows, and revisiting LAN concepts helped reinforce how local networks actually function. Feels good to be documenting this properly and turning it into something I can refer back to (and maybe even show off one day).

**Completed:** Introduction to Networking (TryHackMe)  
**Key Learnings:**
- What a port is
- How TCP/IP communication works
- Difference between TCP and UDP
- Basic concept of IP addresses

**Reflection:**  
Felt good to get back into technical learning â€” this was manageable and helped me shake off a bit of self-doubt after a rough few days. The terminal doesn't feel so scary anymore.
