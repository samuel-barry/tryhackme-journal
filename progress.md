**Completed:** Introduction to Networking (TryHackMe)  
**Key Learnings:**
- What a port is
- How TCP/IP communication works
- Difference between TCP and UDP
- Basic concept of IP addresses

**Reflection:**  
Felt good to get back into technical learning â€” this was manageable and helped me shake off a bit of self-doubt after a rough few days. The terminal doesn't feel so scary anymore.
