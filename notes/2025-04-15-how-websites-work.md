## 🧠 Task 1: How Websites Work

This task explained how websites are made up of two main parts:

- **Front-end (client-side)**: What we see and interact with in the browser (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- **Back-end (server-side)**: Where the logic, databases, and processing happens behind the scenes.

The key takeaway was that when we visit a site, the browser sends a request to the server, which responds with the web page.

## 🧾 Task 2: HTML

We were introduced to HTML as the structure or "skeleton" of a web page. The task asked us to enter a small piece of HTML and render it in a preview window.

What I learned:
- HTML uses opening and closing tags (e.g. `<h1>`, `<p>`)
- It's used to define headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc.

---

## 🎨 Task 3: CSS

This task showed how CSS is used to style HTML. We got to play with an HTML page by changing the color and size of text using CSS rules.

What I learned:
- CSS can be written inside `<style>` tags or in external stylesheets.
- It targets elements using selectors like `p { color: red; }`.

## ⚙️ Task 4: Developer Tools

We were shown how to use browser developer tools (like in Chrome or Firefox) to inspect and manipulate web pages in real time.

What I learned:
- You can right-click and “Inspect” to see the HTML/CSS structure.
- You can live-edit pages to test changes.
- The Console tab is useful for JavaScript and debugging.

## 🧪 Task 5: Viewing Page Source vs Inspect Element

This clarified the difference between:
- **View Page Source**: Shows the original HTML sent by the server.
- **Inspect Element**: Shows the live, possibly modified version (e.g., by JavaScript).

It was useful to understand how websites can change dynamically after load.

## 📦 Task 6: Summary

This final task wrapped up what was covered:
- How websites send and receive data via HTTP
- The difference between front-end and back-end
- How HTML/CSS/JS work together
- How to use dev tools for exploration

---

## ✅ Final Thoughts

This room was a great intro to how web pages are structured and how the browser interacts with them. While it didn’t go deep into code, it gave me a solid base to understand how front-end and back-end pieces connect — which will be useful for security testing later.
