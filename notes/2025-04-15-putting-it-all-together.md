## üåê Task 2: Other Components

This section introduced additional elements that play crucial roles in web infrastructure:

- **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** Distributes static content across multiple servers worldwide to reduce latency and improve load times.

- **Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and performance. It performs **health checks** to verify server availability.

- **WAF (Web Application Firewall):** Protects web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic, defending against common attacks.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **What can be used to host static files and speed up a client's visit to a website?**  
  `CDN`

- **What does a load balancer perform to make sure a host is still alive?**  
  `Health Check`

- **What can be used to help against the hacking of a website?**  
  `WAF`

## üñ•Ô∏è Task 3: How Web Servers Work

This task delved into the workings of web servers and related concepts:

- **Web Server:** Software that handles HTTP requests and serves content to clients. Examples include Apache and Nginx.

- **Virtual Hosts:** Allow a single web server to host multiple domain names on the same IP address by directing requests to different directories based on the requested hostname.

- **Static vs. Dynamic Content:**
  - *Static Content:* Unchanging files like HTML, CSS, and images.
  - *Dynamic Content:* Content generated on-the-fly based on user interaction or other factors, often involving backend processing.

- **Backend Languages:** Languages like PHP, Python, and Node.js that run on the server to generate dynamic content. Importantly, the client does not see the backend code.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **What does web server software use to host multiple sites?**  
  `Virtual Hosts`

- **What is the name for the type of content that can change?**  
  `Dynamic`

- **Does the client see the backend code? Yay/Nay**  
  `Nay`
